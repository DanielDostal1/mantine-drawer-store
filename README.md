# Mantine Multi-Drawer Store Example

This project demonstrates a solution for managing multiple drawers in a React app using Mantine and Zustand. Mantineâ€™s built-in drawer management is limited, so this setup allows you to open and stack multiple drawers programmatically and handle their state more elegantly.

This is just a demo of a better way to handle drawers with Mantine.
